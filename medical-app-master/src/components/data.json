Measurements are taken at the point before the uterine artery branches into the arcuate arteries.\nAs the PSV decreases from the uterine to the arcuate arteries, a measurement of PSV < 5th centile (60 cm/s should prompt the operator to verify carefully the placement of the sample volume.\nDoppler horizontal sweep speed should be fast enough to separate successive waveforms. Ideal is a display of four to six (but no more than eight to 10) complete cardiac cycles. For fetal heart rates of 110-150 bpm, a sweep speed of 50-100 mm/s is adequate. The PI is measured when at least three identical waveforms are obtained. (ISUOG)."
